# Untitled JRPG


## Description
One of the first and most basic types of story-driven games ever made was the turn based role playing game, a genre now referred to as JRPG. Thanks to modern advances in the gaming industry, you hardly see any new ones release as most gamers just want the best graphics achievable in a visceral, fast paced multiplayer game. For the few who miss the classic charm that only pixelated graphics and saving the world through menu combat bring, this is the game for you.

Ideally, at the start of the game the player would be prompted to create a team of four characters from a roster of 10. For MVP, they will preload into a battle with one, maybe two playable characters on their team. When it is the turn of a player's character, they will be able to see the menu buttons and select one action for the character to perform (such as attacking the enemy or healing) , the character will perform it, then their turn will end. When it is an enemy's turn, the enemy will attack a character from the player team at random, then their turn will end. When all the enemies have been defeated (their remaining health, likely displayed above their heads, reaches 0 ), the player wins the battle and obtains rewards to further develop their characters. If every character on the player's team is defeated, the player loses the game and has to start all over from the beginning. 

## Functionality & MVPs

Players will be able to:

    - enjoy retro JRPG combat elements
    - choose and execute commands to defeat hordes of enemies
    - receive experience and gold after a successful battle
    - level up and gain attributes to boost combat prowess

    To play:

    - hover over things for a detailed description
    - click on one of the menu buttons to perform the associated action
    - the enemy will attack on their turn
    - turn order is determined by the unit's speed attribute
    - the player's characters and enemies all have a health bar depictitng their
    remaining health above their heads. When a unit's health is reduced to 0, they
    are defeated and cannot battle anymore. The battle is won if the enemies run out of health,
    the game is over if all of the player's characters run out of health.
    - level up, item use, and skills info pending...
